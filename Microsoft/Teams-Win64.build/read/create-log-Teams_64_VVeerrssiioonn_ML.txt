
200113	Create Teams x64 for Windows
	We build 2 versions of it.
	The first one with no alterations at all.
	Commandline: /qn /norestart ALLUSERS=1 OPTIONS="noAutoStart=true"

	The second one as per computer installation into the program files.
	For this, we need some tweeks.
	The most important things from here with an MST: https://www.masterpackager.com/blog/mst-to-install-microsoft-teams-msi-vdi-to-regular-windows-10
	This gives us the installation mode like in a VDI environment.
	Additionally, we insert an upgrade code. 
	The autorun at login is disabled.
	At last, we configure the firewall with the insertion of the WIX-firewall CA.
