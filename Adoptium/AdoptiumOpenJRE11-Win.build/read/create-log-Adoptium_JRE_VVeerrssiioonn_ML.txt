190813	Adoptium OpenJDK11JRE x86
	Java Runtime Environment for x86 Windows.
	Adoptium is the successor of AdoptOpenJDK.
	The AdoptOpenJDK11JRE is made with a professional CI Buildsystem.
	Unfortunately, it lacks the JavaFX library.
	In this package, we download the JRE from Zulu, which has JFX built in.
	The JFX-files are extracted and packaged into a MergeModule.
	The JFX-MergeModule is then merged into the MSI-package from Adopt.
	That gives a more or less 1:1 substitution for Oracle JRE.
