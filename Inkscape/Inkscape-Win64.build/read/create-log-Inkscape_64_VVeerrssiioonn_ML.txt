
200113	Create Inkscape x64 for Windows
	We alter a few things:
	The desktop shortcut is disabled by default by a condition in the components table:
	CM_SHORTCUT_DESKTOP_inkscape	{83FFBB0F-8DB6-51BC-A883-9CFFFB3673AF}	DesktopFolder	260	DESKTOPSC=1	regC64A5F27E31F95994CD738A4D6A296E9

	We move the shortcuts in the menu folder to a subfolder 'Graphics'
	See the recipe for the exact alterations.

	And we insert the upgrade codes from previous version to make sure, they will be removed.
