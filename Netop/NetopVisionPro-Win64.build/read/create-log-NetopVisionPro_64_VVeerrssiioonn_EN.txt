	This file must be present side by side with the MSI-file on the install location.
	The teacher- and student version use the same MSI-file. The diffrences are all set through "Vision.ini"
	There is an example "Vision.ini" commented out in the build recipe.

	To create an initial Vision.ini file, start the MSI-file by hand and select the prefered options on the wizards dialogs.
	The INI-file will then be written to the output directory.
