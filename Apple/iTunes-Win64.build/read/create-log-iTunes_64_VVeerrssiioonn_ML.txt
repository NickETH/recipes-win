	Analyzing the package, we need to alter this issues:
	1. There are things in iTunesSetup.exe we don't need/want, like Bonjour and AppleSoftwareUpdate.
	   We extract AppleApplicationSupport.msi, AppleMobileDeviceSupport.msi and iTunes.msi
	   As of Sept 2020, AppleApplicationSupport.msi is not part of the package anymore!
	2. User settings are not making it to different users on a machine. We need to provide a run once for those settings.
	   Active Setup is the way to go.
	3. Auto update has to be disabled. We need the AdminFlags Regkey. See: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201677
		AdminFlags to 16777473 (kParentlFlags_DisableFirstRunWelcomeWindow, kParentalFlags_Locked, kParentalFlags_DisableCheckForUpdates)
	4. We need a mechanism to disable the Tray Icon. We move the Regkey, which enables it to its own component.
	5. We don't want the APS deamon installed by AppleApplicationSupport.msi. It is used for wireless sync.
	   We set conditions on those components in the Component table.
	6. To disable th EULA, we need quite some detective work. See:
		https://www.applepie.se/apple-itunes-12-7-and-software-license-agreement-registry-key
		To get the license.rtf file out of the package, we would need the following sequences:
		search for the filetable key: cscript ..\..\MSIScripts\WiRunSQL.vbs iTunes.work.msi "SELECT `File`.`File` FROM `File`, `Component`, `Directory` WHERE `File`.`Component_` = `Component`.`Component` AND `Directory`.`Directory` = `Component`.`Directory_` AND `DefaultDir`='tajvqtga|de.lproj' AND `FileName`='License.rtf'"
		msidb /d .\iTunes64.msi -x iTunes.cab
		7z.exe" e .\iTunes.cab -o.\. "filetable key"
	7. Disable the per default Caching.
	8. We need to rewrite the german (1031) language transform.
