
200113	Create Adobe AIR for Windows
	This software is now distributed by Harman.
	We download it from:
	https://airsdk.harman.com/assets/downloads/AdobeAIR.exe<

	This is an MSI-Installer, but it comes in a strange package with loose files.
	We pack it to a single MSI.
	
	cscript WiMkCab2.vbs setup.msi Data1 /L /C /U /E
	See the recipe for details.


	Configuration settings:

	Disable Auto Update + Installation of "Untrusted Applications" (See Admin-Guide):
	Insert this lines into the Registry table:
	HKLM1	2	Software\Policies\Adobe\AIR	UpdateDisabled	#1	AIR_Policies
	HKLM2	2	Software\Policies\Adobe\AIR	UntrustedAppInstallDisabled	#1	AIR_Policies

	Insert into the Component table:
	AIR_Policies	{0025F296-022D-403E-BA9B-CEC21EB76A1E}	AIR	4		HKLM1

	Insert into the FeatureComponents table:
	Management	AIR_Policies

	To disable the EULA-popup, we need to create a file named "eulaAccepted" containing '3' in:
	%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Adobe\AIR.

	This file goes into a new Cab-File.

	We store 'custom.cab' into the 'Binary' table (this way, it can be put into an MST)

	And we need a new line for the CAB-file in the Media table:
	2	25		#Binary.custom.cab		

	Also a line in the File table:
	eulaAccepted	AIR_EULA_accept	eulaAccepted	4			512	25
	
	A line in the 'MsiFileHash'.

	An entry in the Component table:
	AIR_EULA_accept	{6348E65A-0D8B-4F51-B0E3-069A2E7CA40B}	AIRAdobeCommonAppDataFolder	0	EULAACCEPT	eulaAccepted

	...the FeatureComponents table:
	Management	AIR_EULA_accept

	...and a Property table insert:
	EULAACCEPT	1

	This gives us the possibility to toggle this on the command line.

	All this changes are stored in the transform 'AIR-Corp-config.mst'.
