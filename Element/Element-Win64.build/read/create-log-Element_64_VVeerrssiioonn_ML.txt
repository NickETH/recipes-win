
200113	Create Element x64 for Windows
	Download the Windows exe installer
	Extract the nupkg file and get the sources from it
	Build it to an MSI.
	We create an advertised shortcut and an Active Setup component to copy the config.json to each user profile.
	And advertised shortcut needs an exe icon-file.
	Create an Icon-file with Greenfish Icon Editor Pro.
	New library, import the element.ico and save it as icon library with an .exe extension in 32-bit PE format.
	The inner name seems not to be important.
	Active Setup is a standard aproach with a extra top level feature.
